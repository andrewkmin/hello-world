# starknet 
## getting started
here's an [official guide](https://mirror.xyz/0x83857601C1cFA057F2576b343c563BDB9A4C9975/8HfjYCkbid2vlayxyPtSD9_wtb9a-wHb1uOENsAOwng) on how to get started with your first starknet node deployment! ðŸ¥³

if you're feeling extra creative, and happen to have a spare raspberry pi laying around, here's [another guide](https://github.com/odyslam/starknet-node) on how to get a node up and running on some local hardware. it's *beautifully* simple to get set up, and with a raspberry pi 4 starter pack (like [this one on amazon](https://www.amazon.com/CanaKit-Raspberry-Pi-Extreme-Kit/dp/B08B6F8QRV/)), you could be caught up to tip in a matter of a few hours. i recommend using [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) in order to flash your pi's sd card with the proper os. once you've set up your pi physically, flashed it with the balena-provided os, and started to sync, keep a look out for logs accessible via balena dashboard (url would look something like `https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/devices/<xyz-long-string>/summary`).
